What I've noticed is that people who are not English native speakers were using a language that is so 'textbook'. There were some people who are in the US and their language was completely different and when I was listening to those people, I started noting those differences. I decided to share my insights with you because with these tips you will be able to speak English as a native speaker and won't sound a little old-fashioned. When you're using English from textbooks, you sound a little too academic. With these tips by the end of the class, your English will be more native.\n\nLet's start with a very basic common thing that you probably know but not all of you are using it in your everyday speech. I'm talking about reduced forms. Let's look at some examples:\n‚Ä¢ want to - wanna\n‚Ä¢ don't know - dunno\n\nYou need to decide which accent you want to adopt because you can speak British English, you can speak Canadian English, you can speak Australian English and you can speak American English. There's nothing wrong with either of those accents, it's just you need to be consistent.\n\nLearn to ignore \"fillers\" but also learn how to use them. \nHere is a list of common \"fillers\" in English:\n‚Ä¢ actually\n‚Ä¢ anyway\n‚Ä¢basically\n‚Ä¢ by the way\n‚Ä¢ erm\n‚Ä¢ I mean\n‚Ä¢ incidentally\n‚Ä¢ in fact\n‚Ä¢ obviously\n‚Ä¢ well\n‚Ä¢ you know\n\nNative speakers also almost always use contractions (short words created by combining two separate words) to speak faster. Some examples of common ones:\n‚Ä¢ I + am = I‚Äôm\n‚Ä¢ I + will = I‚Äôll\n‚Ä¢ do + not = don‚Äôt\n‚Ä¢ I + have = I‚Äôve\n‚Ä¢ I + would= I‚Äôd\n\nNext tip. Use slang! Yes, we've learnt a lot of slang words with you but I just want to emphasize that people use those slang words a lot because sometimes you learn them and you're in your country and you're like 'whatever'. But then, you start interacting with native speakers and suddenly they're like: \"Do you want to hang out with me?\" And you're like: \"What was that?\" To hang out means to spend time together.\n\nEnglish idioms are phrases whose meanings aren‚Äôt obvious from looking at the individual words.\nThe use of idioms might not be as common as slang in informal speech. However, native speakers can use idioms at times and mystify you.\n\nTime codes:\n1:16 Use reduced forms\n2:49 Decide which accent you want to adopt\n4:16 About my English workbook\n5:25 Learn to ignore \"fillers\"\n7:14 Use contractions\n8:26 Pay attention to stress\n9:07 Use slang\n10:10 Learn idioms\n\n‚≠ê INSTAGRAM - linguamarina\n‚≠ê LEARN LANGUAGES ABROAD - https://linguatrip.com\n‚≠ê ENROLL IN MY YOUTUBE COURSE - https://bit.ly/2D1Z6gf\n‚≠ê DOWNLOAD MY ENGLISH WORKBOOK - https://bit.ly/3tqj5A1\n\nüìù Get your English text corrected instantly - https://fluent.express/\n\nüì∑ FILMING EQUIPMENT\n- Gear for making my 'talking head' videos - https://kit.co/linguamarina/gear-for-youtube\n- Gear for vlogging - https://kit.co/linguamarina/current-vlogging-setup\n\nüéàPROMOS\n$20 TO SPEND ON UBER - http://ubr.to/2k1B89L\n\nI use affiliate links whenever possible (if you purchase items listed above using my affiliate links, I will get a bonus)\n\n#LearnEnglish #FastEnglish #SpeakEnglishFast",

          'Today, we\'re going to talk about how to speak English fast and understand native speakers.\nDownload my English workbook - https://marinamogilko.co/workbook\n\nThe video was filmed in this location (Malibu): https://bit.ly/393NFEj\n\nNative English speakers speak in a way that\'s easy for them and if you want to sound like an American person, you need to relax because Americans like to omit words, they like to connect sounds, etc. Below is the list of other two videos dedicated to this topic:\n\nHow to speak English fast and understand natives (Part VII) ‚û°Ô∏è https://youtu.be/dapSJHdfXkQ\nHow to speak English fast and understand natives (Part VI) ‚û°Ô∏è https://youtu.be/o7kaiETLRbw\nHow to speak English fast and understand natives (Part V) ‚û°Ô∏è https://youtu.be/GoMjQS_9Q8M\nHow to speak English fast and understand natives (Part IV) ‚û°Ô∏è https://youtu.be/8haAfv996aQ\nHow to speak English fast and understand natives (Part II) ‚û°Ô∏è https://youtu.be/5wr44LGmIaw\nHow to speak English fast and understand natives (Part I) ‚û°Ô∏è https://youtu.be/MiebCHmiszs\n\n(1) CUT OFF WORDS. This is something native English speakers often do. It‚Äôs casual and not too professional. But it‚Äôs conversational and natural-sounding English.\nExample: "good talking to you" instead of "it was good talking to you"\n\n(2) SHORTEN WORDS. The most common examples are congrats (congratulations), thanks (thank you), totes (totally)\n\n(3) UNDERSTAND HINTS. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so cold!‚Äù This can mean it‚Äôs really just cold. But it can also be trying to hint at closing the window or turning the air conditioning off. \n\n(4) DETECT SARCASM. Native English speakers will know how to inject sarcasm in their words and sentences. ‚ÄúOh yeah, it‚Äôs so cold‚Äù could actually mean that it is hot outside!\n\n(5) CONNECT SOUNDS. In the first video dedicated to this topic, we were talking about how hard it is to know when one word stops and another one starts because native speakers connect them together. For example, you will hear English speakers saying "Coudjou help me?" instead of "Could you help me?"\n\n(6) "YEAH" INSTEAD OF "YES". You can hear people saying "yeah" all the time and you can use it too. But remember, appropriate use is also key. If you are in a formal set up or scenario, then stick to your professional English.\n\n(7) "NO PROB" INSTEAD OF "NO PROBLEM". This is an example of a shortened phrase. "No prob" is short for "no problem". And native English speakers are big in using this.\n\nTime codes:\n00:00 How do Americans speak?\n01:02 Why you need to sound like a native\n01:46 Cut off words\n02:45 Shorten words\n04:49 About my English workbook\n05:15 Understand hints\n06:33 Detect sarcasm\n08:29 Connect sounds\n09:09 "Yeah" instead of "yes"\n09:35 "No prob" instead of "no problem"\n\nVideographer: Oleg Shevchyshyn (https://instagram.com/oleg_shevchyshyn)\n\n‚≠ê INSTAGRAM - linguamarina\n‚≠ê LEARN LANGUAGES ABROAD - https://linguatrip.com\n‚≠ê ENROLL IN MY YOUTUBE COURSE - https://bit.ly/2D1Z6gf\n‚≠ê DOWNLOAD MY ENGLISH WORKBOOK - https://bit.ly/3tqj5A1\n\nüìù Get your English text corrected instantly - https://fluent.express/\n\nüì∑ FILMING EQUIPMENT\n- Gear for making my \'talking head\' videos - https://kit.co/linguamarina/gear-for-youtube\n- Gear for vlogging - https://kit.co/linguamarina/current-vlogging-setup\n\nüéàPROMOS\n$20 TO SPEND ON AIRBNB - http://bit.ly/2g0F87Q\n$20 TO SPEND ON UBER - http://ubr.to/2k1B89L\n\nI use affiliate links whenever possible (if you purchase items listed above using my affiliate links, I will get a bonus)\n\n#FastEnglish #SpeakEnglishFast #UnderstandNatives',

There are a large number of words in English which can have a "full" form and a "weak" form. This is because English is a stressed timed language, and in trying to make the intervals between stressed syllables equal, to give the phrase rhythm, we tend to swallow non-essential words. Thus, conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions, auxiliaries and articles are often lost. \n\n(2) LINKING. Linking is probably what most people think of first when they think of connected speech. Linking happens when the end of one word blends into another.\n\n(3) ELISION. Elision means the omission of one or more sounds. Generally, one sound is changed by a similar or stronger sound next to it. Sound /n/ followed by /t/ is usually pronounced as double /n/, double /t/ is often pronounced as double /d/ or /l/. \n\n(4) ASSIMILATION. Assimilation is when two sounds combine, creating a new one.\n\n(5) INTRUSION. Intrusion means an additional sound ‚Äúintrudes‚Äù or inserts itself between others. It is often is a /j/ or /w/ or /r/ sound between two other vowel sounds.\n\n(6) GEMINATES. They are like twins. Often when one word ends with the same letter as the beginning of the next word, you should connect the two words in your speech.\n\nTime codes:\n0:00 Why you don\'t understand native speakers\n1:13 Avoid non-essential words\n3:19 Link words together\n4:18 Substitute one sound with another one\n6:24 Singers do this all the time\n7:40 What is intrusion and how it can help you speak fast\n8:17 When two words become one\n8:53 About ‚ÄúLearn to Speak English Like an American‚Äù intensive course\n\n‚≠ê INSTAGRAM - linguamarina\n‚≠ê LEARN LANGUAGES ABROAD - https://linguatrip.com\n‚≠ê ENROLL IN MY YOUTUBE COURSE - https://bit.ly/2D1Z6gf\n‚≠ê DOWNLOAD MY ENGLISH WORKBOOK - https://bit.ly/3tqj5A1\n\nüìù Get your English text corrected instantly - https://fluent.express/\n\nüì∑ FILMING EQUIPMENT\n- Gear for making my \'talking head\' videos - https://kit.co/linguamarina/gear-for-youtube\n- Gear for vlogging - https://kit.co/linguamarina/current-vlogging-setup\n\nüéàPROMOS\n$20 TO SPEND ON UBER - http://ubr.to/2k1B89L\n\nI use affiliate links whenever possible (if you purchase items listed above using my affiliate links, I will get a bonus)\n\n#LearnEnglish #FastEnglish #SpeakEnglishFast',

While in English, in order to pronounce some sound correctly, it‚Äôs necessary to open your mouth quite wide, because otherwise, you‚Äôll get a completely different word.\n08:47 Present Perfect VS Past Simple\nIn spoken American English people tend to use Past Simple whereas in British English people would use Present Perfect. It doesn‚Äôt mean that if you want to speak American English, you don‚Äôt need to learn perfect tenses. You have to.\n09:50 Learn English with my workbook\n10:32 Exaggerate\nAmericans really like exaggerating.
